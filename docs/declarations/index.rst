Additional Declarations
=======================

This section contains a number of additional example declarations you can use. Use the following index, or the links on the right to go to a specific category of declaration.

If you want to see an example that uses all of available BIG-IP AS3 properties, see the :ref:`all properties declaration<all-properties>`. 

.. IMPORTANT:: Most of the example declarations have been updated in the documentation for BIG-IP AS3 3.20 to remove any **template** that was specified, and rename any virtual services that used the name **serviceMain** to **service**. In BIG-IP AS3 3.20, the **generic** template is the default, which allows services to use any name.  |br| |br| This also means that many of these declarations on a version prior to 3.20 they will fail unless you add a template.  See :ref:`this FAQ entry <servmain-ref>` and :ref:`this Troubleshooting entry<exampleupdates>` for more information.

.. NOTE:: Some of the examples may be in multiple categories.
