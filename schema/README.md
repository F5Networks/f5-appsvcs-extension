## AS3 Schema files
In this directory you will find the JSON schema files used by AS3. There are folders with schema files for all of the supported AS3 versions, including our long-term support (LTS) version (3.5.1), and the latest release. Beginning with AS3 3.8.0, the schema files have been consolidated into a single file: as3-schema.json. Beginning with AS3 3.56.0, an additional consolidated schema file has been added which is needed for tools that
validate per-application declarations.

For more information on versioning, see https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-appsvcs-extension/blob/main/SUPPORT.md.
