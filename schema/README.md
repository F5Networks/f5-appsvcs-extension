## AS3 Schema files
In this directory you will find the JSON schema files used by AS3. There are folders with schema files for our long-term support (LTS) version, 3.5.1, and the latest release.  Beginning with AS3 3.8.0, the schema files have been consolidated into a single file: as3-schema.json.

For more information on versioning, see https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-appsvcs-extension/blob/master/SUPPORT.md.
