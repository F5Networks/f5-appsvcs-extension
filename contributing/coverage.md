Coverage can be generated for a running AS3 process and accessed remotely with the NPM module `istanbul-middleware`.
The debug build of AS3 includes this module and can be enabled by creating a file named "debug" in the root directory of the AS3 installation.
After that, restarting the restnoded service will allow AS3 to begin gathering coverage.
When AS3 begins gathering coverage, it creates an express server on port 8080 and exposes the coverage data at the `/coverage` enpoint.
Besides viewing the data at this endpoint, devs can also download, reset, and merge the coverage data:

<table>
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th>URL</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td><code>GET&nbsp;/</code></td>
        <td>
            Dynamic code coverage HTML report showing live coverage.
            Clickable  with drill-downs just like the static version
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>POST&nbsp;/reset</code></td>
        <td>Reset coverage to baseline numbers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>GET&nbsp;/download</code></td>
        <td>Download a zip file with coverage JSON, HTML and lcov reports</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>POST&nbsp;/client</code></td>
        <td>
            Allows you to post a coverage object for client-side code coverage from the browser.
            Must be a JSON object with a <code>Content-type: application/json</code> header.
            This object is aggregated with the stats already present on the server
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Steps for Generating Coverage
---------
1.  Build "debug" RPM of AS3

    `./scripts/build/buildRpm.sh debug`

2.  Install on BIG-IP

    `./scripts/dev/install-rpm.sh $AS3_HOST $AS3_USERNAME:$AS3_PASSWORD`

3.  Enable coverage by creating debug file on BIG-IP and restarting restnoded

    `touch /var/config/rest/iapps/f5-appsvcs/debug && bigstart restart restnoded`

4.  Verify coverage is being generated by viewing in browser

    http://$AS3_HOST:8080/coverage
