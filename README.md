## Introduction
F5 BIG-IP Application Services 3 Extension (F5 BIG-IP AS3) is a flexible, low-overhead mechanism for managing application-specific configurations on a F5 BIG-IP system. BIG-IP AS3 uses a declarative model, meaning you provide a JSON declaration rather than a set of imperative commands.

**IMPORTANT** Beginning with BIG-IP AS3 3.15.0, the RPM, Postman Collection, and checksum files will no longer be located in the **/dist** directory in this repository.  These files can be found on the [Release page](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-appsvcs-extension/releases), as **Assets**.  
You can find historical files by using the **Branch** drop-down, clicking the **Tags** tab, and then selecting the appropriate release.

If you come across a bug or other issue when using BIG-IP AS3, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-appsvcs-extension/issues) to submit an issue for our team.  You can also see the current known issues on that page, which are tagged with a purple Known Issue label.  

**Important**: Github Issues are consistently monitored by F5 staff, but should be considered as best effort only and you should not expect to receive the same level of response as provided by F5 Support. Please open a case as described below with F5 if this is a critical issue.

Because BIG-IP AS3 has been created and fully tested by F5 Networks, it is fully supported by F5. This means you can get assistance if necessary from [F5 Technical Support](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K25327565).
