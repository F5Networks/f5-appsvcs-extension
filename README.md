## Introduction
Application Services 3 Extension (AS3) is a flexible, low-overhead mechanism for managing application-specific configurations on a BIG-IP system. AS3 uses a declarative model, meaning you provide a JSON declaration rather than a set of imperative commands. 

## Documentation
For more information on AS3, including download, installation, and usage instructions, see the AS3 User and Reference guides, at https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension.

## Filing Issues and Getting Help

Because AS3 is has been created and fully tested by F5 Networks, it is fully supported by F5. This means you can get assistance if necessary from [F5 Technical Support](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K25327565).
